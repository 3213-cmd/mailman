* Notes
Testing all the functions turns out to be harder than expected, because of different mail providers behaving differently when interacting with their IMAP servers.
The reasons for the different behavior and timeouts  are not always documented.
- GMX seems not to have any rate limits
- Microsoft seems to rate-limit when the same operation is performed twice on the same object, which does not make it an optimal platform for testing.
- Google has not been tested, but seems to have daily usage limits see: [[TODO -> insert link][Gmail Bandwith Limits]]


* OAUTH2
Some commercial mail providers seem to be switching to OAUTH2, this is something worth considering to implement in the future
